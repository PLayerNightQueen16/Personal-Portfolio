            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Having been a student of Army Public Schools throughout my childhood, I’ve had the privilege of studying
                in
                ten different institutions across India over the span of twelve years of formal education. This dynamic
                academic journey not only gave me a strong educational foundation but also instilled in me adaptability,
                cultural awareness, and the ability to thrive in diverse environments — values that continue to shape
                both
                my academic and personal growth.
            </p><br>

            <p>After completing my higher secondary education, I received offer letters from several international
                universities, including Dongshin University and Seoul National University, recognizing my academic
                performance and global potential. However, I chose to pursue my undergraduate studies in India at the
                Scaler
                School of Technology, one of the nation’s most forward-thinking new-age institutions focused on
                technology,
                innovation, and industry-integrated learning.
            </p><br>

            <p>In parallel, I am also pursuing a B.Sc. in Data Science and Applications from the Indian Institute of
                Technology (IIT) Madras, one of India’s most prestigious universities. Through this dual academic path,
                I
                aim to blend strong theoretical foundations with real-world technical expertise, preparing myself to
                excel
                in the rapidly evolving fields of data science and technology.

            <p>
                I am a versatile and passionate technologist with a solid foundation in programming languages such as
                Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and SQL. I am well-versed in object-oriented programming, functional
                programming paradigms, and algorithm optimization, which allows me to write efficient, scalable, and
                maintainable code across multiple domains.
            </p><br>

            <p>In the realm of web and software development, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, and
                modern frontend frameworks, with a strong focus on responsive design and UI/UX best practices. I also
                have
                experience working with APIs, RESTful services, and version control systems like Git and GitHub,
                enabling
                seamless collaboration and deployment in real-world projects.
            </p><br>

            <p>My expertise extends to data science, machine learning, and cloud technologies. I am skilled in Python
                libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and
                Scikit-learn
                for building predictive models. Additionally, I am familiar with database management systems like MySQL,
                PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and have experience with cloud platforms such as AWS and Docker, bridging the
                gap
                between data-driven insights and scalable solutions.

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Throughout my journey in web development, I have built several foundational projects to strengthen my
                understanding of HTML and CSS. My first project, My First Webpage, served as a stepping stone where I
                learned to structure a complete webpage with headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Following that, I
                created a Weekend Plans List, a simple yet functional webpage to organize tasks and events, and a Movie
                Collection Table, which enhanced my skills in creating structured content using tables. The Contact Form
                project introduced me to interactive elements of a webpage, while the Semantic Webpage helped me
                practice
                using semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility and SEO. Additionally, the Recipe Page allowed me to
                experiment with images, lists, and content organization to present recipes clearly and attractively.</p>
            <br>

            <p>To further explore CSS and design principles, I created projects that focused on layout, styling, and
                responsiveness. In CSS Shapes, I practiced creating geometric shapes and animations purely using CSS,
                while
                Responsive Profile Card taught me the importance of designing for different screen sizes and devices.
                Grid
                Layout was a project dedicated to mastering CSS Grid for creating clean, structured, and visually
                appealing
                layouts. Similarly, Photo Gallery combined both grid and flexbox techniques to arrange images elegantly
                while maintaining responsiveness. These projects reinforced my understanding of design principles,
                spacing,
                alignment, and visual aesthetics.</p><br>

            <p>Finally, I ventured into more creative and visually dynamic projects, combining HTML, CSS, and animation
                skills. Moon Orbit and Ferris Wheel allowed me to simulate motion and rotation using CSS animations,
                pushing
                my skills in transitions, keyframes, and dynamic styling. Each of these projects, whether functional,
                aesthetic, or interactive, contributed to building a solid foundation in web development, allowing me to
                experiment, learn from challenges, and gradually enhance my coding and design capabilities.
                Collectively,
                these experiences have shaped my proficiency in HTML and CSS, preparing me for more advanced projects in
                the
                future.
